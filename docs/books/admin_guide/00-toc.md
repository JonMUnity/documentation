# Learning Linux with Rocky

The Administrator's Guide is a collection of educational documents focused on System Administrators. They can be used by future System Administrators trying to get up to speed, by current System Administrators who want a refresher, or by any Linux user who wants to learn more about the Linux environment, commands, processes, and more. Like all documents of this type, it evolves and updates over time.

The Administrator's guide starts with an Introduction to Linux, which outlines Linux, distributions, and the whole ecosystem around our operating system.

User Commands documents essential commands for getting up to speed with Linux. More experienced users can consult the chapter on Advanced Linux Commands.

The vi text editor deserves its own chapter. While Linux includes many editors, vi is one of the most powerful. Other commands sometimes use the same syntax that vi uses, such as `sed`. So, knowing something about vi, or at least demystifying its essential functions (how to open a file, save, quit or quit without saving), is very important. The user will become more comfortable with the other functions of vi as they use the editor. An alternative to vi is nano. nano is installed by default in Rocky Linux. While not as versatile, it can be easier to use, straightforward, and gets the job done.

We can then get into the deep functioning of Linux to discover how the system addresses:

* User Management
* File Systems
* Process Management

Backup and Restoration is essential info for the System Administrator. Linux includes software solutions to enhance backups. For example, rsnapshot and lsyncd.). It is valuable to know the essential components of the backup that exist within the operating system. We investigate two tools: `tar` and the less widespread `cpio` in this chapter.

System Startup is also an important read because management of the system during the boot process has evolved significantly in recent years since the arrival of the systemd.


Final chapters address Task Management, Implementing the Network, and Software Management including installation.
